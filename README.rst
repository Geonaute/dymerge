`DyMerge <https://nikolaskama.me/dymergeproject/>`_ - Dynamic Dictionary Merger

A simple, yet powerful tool - written purely in python - which takes given
wordlists and merges them into one dynamic dictionary that can then be used
as ammunition for a successful dictionary based (or bruteforce) attack.

Compatible with Python 2.6+.
